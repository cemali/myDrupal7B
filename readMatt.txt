#using anchors Panels Navigation required several modules to be loaded.
# such as multilingual, panels, and variable, jquery ui
# these modules were loaded on site3.local and the single page website module will be loaded on
# site2.locale. 
# thought anchors panels navigation was single page, but it was not and since I loaded it already
# I just left it there.

# 10/22/2015 - Since last time I have worked with Compass/Sass -- and using wireframes with myzen # sub-theme. Now this site has bootstrap theme from the main theme directory. Also bootstrap does # not uses sass css, it uses less . so Sassy and sass will not work with boostrap. 
# Sass and Sassy is a css framework and is very flexiable with grids. I must decide which on to go
# with
#
# I stand corrected, Bootstrap does work with compass sass. working on the
# results today, 1-31-2016.
# I have added compass sass to the directory structure of localhost/drupal under bootstrap 3.0
# there are two styles sheets being used style and styles. I will used them for background colors and alike.
# I copied the bootstrap style.css to my compass stylesheet directory and then modified it to work with the colors.
# but it does not work with multiple stylesheets. so my variables stylesheet does not work with it. 
# in summary only one style sheet can work at a time with drupal bootstrap. The two directories are stylesheet and css
# where both stylesheet goes so if style.css gets deleted, the original one is under css/style.css.
